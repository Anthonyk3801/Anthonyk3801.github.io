I have a great work ethic, I am hardworking, I am self motivated and I work well in teams. I strive to do the best I can do at all times. I want to continue expanding my knowledge in programming so that I can be an asset to a company. My goal is to obtain an entry level position working in the field of programming.

What I love about programming is the design aspects and problem solving. I want to be able to create something that the end user will love.
